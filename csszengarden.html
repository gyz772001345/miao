  View source is a feature, not a bug. Thanks for your curiosity and
  interest in participatng!

  Here are the submission guideines for the new and improved csszengarden.com:

  - css3 ? of course! Prefix for ALL browsers where necessary.
  - go responsive, test your layout at multiple screen sizes.
  - your broeser testing baseline: IE9+, recent Chrome/Firefox/Safari,and IOS/Android
  - use classes for styling. Don't use ids.
  - web fonts are cool, just make sure you hava a license to share the files. Hosted
    services that are appliedvia the CSS file(ie. Google Fouts) will work fine, but
    most that require custom HTML won't. TypeKit is supported, see the readme on this
    page for usage instrutions: http://gitbub.com/mezzoblue/csszengardan.com/

  And a few tips on building your CSS file:

  - use :first-child,:last-child and :nth-child to get at non-classed elements
  - use ::before and ::after to create pseudo-elements for extra styling
  - use multiple background images to apply as you need to any element
  - use the Kellum Method for image replacement, if still needed. http://goo.gl/GXcdI
  - don't rely on the extra divs at the bottom. Use::before and::after instead.

      <h3>The Road to Enlightenment</h3>
      <p>Littering a dark and dreary road lay the past relics of browser-specific tags, incompatible <abbr title="Document Object Model">DOM</abbr>s,broken<abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr>support, and abandoned browsers.</p>
      <p>We must clear the mind of the past. Web enlightenment has been achieved thanks to the tireless efforts of folk like the<abbr title="World Wide Web Consortium">W3C</abbr>,<abbr title="Web Standards Project">WaSP</abbr>, and the major browser creators.</p>
      <p>The CSS Zen Garden invites you to relax and meditate on the important lessons of the masters. Begin to see with clarity. Learn to use the time-honored techniques in new and invigorating fashion. Become one with the web.</p>

    <h3>Benefits</h3>
    <p>Why participate? For recognition, inspiration, and a resource we can all refer to showing people how amazing <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> really can be. This site serves as equal parts inspiration for those working on the web today, learning tool for those who will be tomorrow, and gallery of future techniques we can all look forward to.</p>
 </div>

 <div class="requirements" id="zen-requirements" role="article">
  <h3>Requirements</h3>
  <p>Where possible, we would like to see mostly <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets, levels 1 and 2">CSS 1 &amp; 2</abbr> usage. <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets, levels 3 and 4">CSS 3 &amp; 4</abbr> should be limited to widely-supported elements only, or strong fallbacks should be provided. The CSS Zen Garden is about functional, practical <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> and not the latest bleeding-edge tricks viewable by 2% of the browsing public. The only real requirement we have is that your <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> validates.</p>
  <p>Luckily, designing this way shows how well various browsers have implemented <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> by now. When sticking to the guidelines you should see fairly consistent results across most modern browsers. Due to the sheer number of user agents on the web these days &#8212; especially when you factor in mobile &#8212; pixel-perfect layouts may not be possible across every platform. That&#8217;s okay, but do test in as many as you can. Your design should work in at least IE9+ and the latest Chrome, Firefox, iOS and Android browsers (run by over 90% of the population).</p>
  <p>We ask that you submit original artwork. Please respect copyright laws. Please keep objectionable material to a minimum, and try to incorporate unique and interesting visual themes to your work. We&#8217;re well past the point of needing another garden-related design.</p>
  <p>This is a learning exercise as well as a demonstration. You retain full copyright on your graphics (with limited exceptions, see <a href="http://www.mezzoblue.com/zengarden/submit/guidelines/">submission guidelines</a>), but we ask you release your <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> under a Creative Commons license identical to the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/" title="View the Zen Garden's license information.">one on this site</a> so that others may learn from your work.</p>
